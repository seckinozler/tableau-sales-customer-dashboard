# 📊 Sales & Customer Dashboard | 2020–2023 (Tableau)

An interactive, multi-page Tableau dashboard designed to analyze key sales metrics, customer performance, and year-over-year trends from 2020 through 2023. It is structured to support strategic decision-making through advanced filtering, KPI comparisons, and segmented insights.

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard helps answer key business questions such as:

- How have sales, profit, and order quantities evolved over time?
- Which product subcategories contribute most to profitability or loss?
- Who are the top-performing customers based on profit?
- How do yearly trends compare with previous years (YoY)?

All KPIs dynamically update based on selected year (2020–2023) and are compared with the previous year.
