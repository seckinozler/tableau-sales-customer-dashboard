An interactive, multi-page Tableau dashboard designed to analyze key sales metrics, customer performance, and year-over-year trends from 2020 through 2023. It is structured to support strategic decision-making through advanced filtering, KPI comparisons, and segmented insights.

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard helps answer key business questions like:

- How have sales, profit, and order quantities evolved over time?
